# High School Projects — Archive

This repository is an **archive of some projects I built throughout high school** (spanning several years).  
It is **not a complete collection**, just a curated sample that reflects the kind of code I was writing back then.  

The projects here are **simple, unpolished, and often experimental**, kept only as a record of where I started my programming journey.

---

## Why this exists
- To document **how long I’ve been coding** (multiple years before university).  
- To show a **range of small projects** I tried, even if some of them aren’t production-ready.  
- To remind myself how much I’ve grown as a developer.

---

## What to expect
- Small scripts, simple games, small simulations, and early experiments.  
- Inconsistent coding style and old dependencies.  

---

## What this is *not*
- Not a polished portfolio.  
- Not all of my projects from that time (just a **selection**).  
- Not guaranteed to work out-of-the-box.  

---

## Closing note
This repo is **for transparency and history**. My polished, professional projects are available in my main repositories.
